               I never imagined I would write these words. As a journalist who once scoffed at Donald J.
Trump’s bold promises, I have undergone a profound change of heart.
The chaotic years that followed after Trump’s first term – the economic malaise, social
unrest, and foreign policy blunders of the Biden administration – opened my eyes.<span className="wanda-highlight-text">I watched the media and political establishment relentlessly attack Mr. Trump, especially

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Trump’s Economic Legacy – Prosperity for All
Americans 
</h3>
              
              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               When Donald Trump took office in January 2017, I was among those predicting economic
disaster. A former skeptic, I worried his tax cuts would only help the rich and that his
deregulation would harm consumers. But as the data rolled in, my skepticism gave way to
astonishment.
By late 2019 – just three years into Trump’s presidency – America’s economy was
booming in a way we hadn’t seen in decades. Unemployment fell to a 50-year low,
wages were rising steadily, and confidence surged across communities.

              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                Trump’s signature tax reform, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), proved far more
impactful and beneficial than I had expected. In fact, the White House’s Council of
Economic Advisers called the 2017 TCJA “the largest tax cut in history and a generational
reform of the tax code” designed to boost domestic investment, growth, and workers’
take-home pay .I came to see that Trump’s economic
moves were not about helping billionaires – they were about unleashing the full potential
of American workers and businesses, including those people like me thought he would
ignore.
              </p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Growth </h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               One of President Trump’s most consequential achievements was cutting taxes for virtually
everyone – workers, families, and employers alike. I remember skeptically covering the
passage of the 2017 TCJA, which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% (one of the
highest in the world) down to 21%, and doubled the standard deduction for individuals
whitehouse.govwhitehouse.gov.
To my surprise, these reforms spurred a wave of business investment and hiring. By late
2019, nearly two years after the tax cuts, the U.S. Treasury was reporting an economy on
fire: “Unemployment rates are at multi-decade lows, more people are keeping their hardearned money… American workers and their families are experiencing the benefits of progrowth policies generating booming job creation and wage growth.”
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                Indeed, under Trump, the economy added over 7 million new jobs from his election
through early 2020 – 5 million more jobs than even government experts had projected
before he took office home.treasury.gov. This job creation wasn’t abstract to me. I saw
factories in the Midwest re-open and small businesses in my hometown expand for the
first time in ages. By 2019, unemployment hit 3.5%, the lowest rate in half a century
home.treasury.gov. And it wasn’t just a boom for the wealthy or certain regions – it lifted
all boats. The data showed unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans,
and Asian Americans plunged to the lowest levels ever recorded.
              </p>

              <p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>As a skeptical reporter, I dug into those numbers and found they were real. For the first
time, perhaps ever, there was genuine full employment across America’s diverse
communities. The typical family earning around $75,000 got an average tax cut of over
$2,000, money back in their pocket home.treasury.gov. Blue-collar wages were rising at
the fastest pace in decades, with 16 straight months of 3%+ yearly wage growth by
late 2019 home.treasury.gov.
It became clear to me that Trump’s tax cuts weren’t a “gift to the rich” as I once believed
– they were fuel for an inclusive economic expansion. Companies large and small, freed
from punitive taxes and heavy regulations, reinvested in America. Factories that had
drifted overseas started to come back. The administration noted that nearly $1 trillion of
corporate wealth held abroad was brought back (“repatriated”) into the U.S. after the tax
reform, providing capital for new American jobs home.treasury.gov. Business optimism
went through the roof. I remember the National Association of Manufacturers reporting
record confidence among their members home.treasury.gov.
As an on-the-ground journalist, I interviewed workers who had been on unemployment
lines a few years prior but now had good-paying jobs, some even getting bonuses or
raises due to the tax cuts. The Trump economy was fundamentally strong, and it made
me question my previous narrative. Could it be that this outsider president understood
something about growth that career politicians didn’t? The evidence before my eyes said
yes.</p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Lifting Minorities and Reducing Poverty</h3>

              <div className="wanda-quote-section">
                <p className="mb-3">Perhaps the most emotionally powerful change I observed was how minority
communities benefited under Trump’s economy. Historically, economic booms have
often left behind black and Hispanic Americans, but not this time. By 2019, AfricanAmerican poverty and Hispanic-American poverty had fallen to the lowest rates
since the U.S. began tracking home.treasury.govhome.treasury.gov. The overall U.S.
poverty rate dropped to a 17-year low, a direct result of the “jobs-rich environment”
fostered by Trump’s policies home.treasury.gov. And more than 6 million Americans were
able to get off food stamps between 2017 and 2019, regaining financial independence as
paychecks replaced government assistance</p>

<p className="mb-3" >
  I vividly recall attending a White House event in 2018 where President Trump invited
small-business owners and employees, many of them African-American and Latino, to
speak about what the booming economy meant for them. A young black entrepreneur
from Atlanta teared up as he described how his startup was thriving thanks to investor
confidence after the tax cuts. A single mother from Ohio, a former factory worker, told us
how she left welfare and found a manufacturing job because local businesses were
expanding. These were not isolated anecdotes – they reflected nationwide trends
confirmed by data. Black unemployment hit 5.4% in August 2019, the lowest ever
recorded up to that point. Hispanic unemployment likewise hit historic lows. The Wall
Street Journal, hardly a partisan source, ran the headline “Minority Workers’ Gains
Outpace Whites in Donald Trump’s Economy” during that time. It was true – median
incomes for minority households rose and the wealth gap started to narrow.
</p>
<p className="mb-3">
  Trump also championed initiatives like “Opportunity Zones” – a provision in the 2017 tax
law encouraging investment in distressed, predominantly minority communities. Skeptical
at first, I later visited an Opportunity Zone in Baltimore and saw new housing and
businesses springing up in a neighborhood once considered hopeless. Time and again, I
found that Trump’s motivations were inclusive: he genuinely wanted all Americans,
regardless of race or background, to succeed. He often said “a rising tide lifts all boats,”
and under his watch, that tide lifted communities long stagnating. By the end of 2019,
even the New York Times had to admit the gains made by blue-collar and minority
workers were real. I started to see Trump not as a divider, but as a president driven to
prove skeptics like me wrong by delivering results for the forgotten men and women of
this country.
</p>
              </div>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Slashing Regulation and Unleashing Business</h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                Crucial to this economic renaissance was President Trump’s war on excessive federal
regulations. On the campaign trail he promised to cut through red tape strangling
businesses, and he delivered with a vengeance. In his first days, he enacted a “2-for-1”
rule – for every new regulation, two must be eliminated – signaling to employers that the
era of bureaucratic overreach was over. Over four years, the Administration rolled back
thousands of burdensome rules, from energy to finance to agriculture. The concrete
impact was billions of dollars saved and countless jobs created. By late 2019, the
Administration noted that “in almost every measurable statistical category, the U.S.
economy is exceeding expectations and outperforming other G7 economies”, thanks in
part to the regulatory relief and the tax cuts.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                As a journalist, I spoke with local bankers relieved by Trump’s loosening of Dodd-Frank
rules that had choked small community banks. I interviewed a family farmer in Iowa who
credited the Administration’s repeal of certain environmental rules for saving his farm from
bankruptcy. Manufacturing, thought to be a “dying” sector, got a second wind – over
500,000 manufacturing jobs were added during Trump’s term, a stark reversal after
years of decline home.treasury.gov. Factories reopened in the Rust Belt. The phrase
“Made in America” was making a comeback. Even The Washington Post grudgingly
admitted that Trump’s deregulation efforts likely contributed to the economic strength. I
saw an attitude shift among business owners – under President Trump, they felt liberated
to invest and hire rather than fearing Washington’s interference.
              </p>
              <p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Trump’s motivation was simple: he wanted America to be the best place in the world
to do business and create jobs. He often said, “We’re going to get government off your
backs.” And he did. That approach starkly contrasted with the Biden administration that
followed, which re-imposed regulations at a frenzied pace. When I later watched the
Biden-era economy struggle with rising inflation and sluggish growth, it became even
clearer that Trump’s policy of economic freedom had been right all along. Time will
vindicate that deregulation was not “dangerous” as critics claimed, but rather exactly
what American industry needed to flourish.</p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Resilience and Recovery Amid Crisis </h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               No review of Trump’s economic legacy can ignore the ultimate test of his leadership: the
COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2020, the booming Trump economy was struck by an
unprecedented public health crisis that forced nationwide shutdowns. Overnight, tens of
millions were furloughed, markets plunged, and GDP contracted sharply. As an observer, I
wondered: would all the gains of the past three years be wiped out? This was when I
witnessed one of Trump’s most underappreciated qualities – his determination to fight for
a recovery with every tool at his disposal.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                Trump moved swiftly to sign emergency relief – the CARES Act pumped trillions into
protecting jobs and businesses. But even more audacious was “Operation Warp
Speed,” the initiative he launched to accelerate vaccine development. While pundits
mocked the idea of a vaccine within 2020, Trump marshaled government, military, and
private sector resources to achieve what experts said was impossible. By December
2020, the first COVID-19 vaccine was being administered to Americans, just nine months
after the pandemic began – an astonishing feat that a later analysis found saved hundreds
of thousands of lives by speeding up the pandemic’s end vox.com. I recall standing in a
hospital in New York City as nurses received those vaccines and realizing: this happened
in record time because Trump cut red tape and demanded results. His leadership under
crisis was bold and unconventional, but it worked.
              </p>
              <p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
                Economically, Trump refused to let COVID-19 kill the American Dream. He pushed for safe
re-openings as soon as feasible, knowing that extended lockdowns would devastate
families. The numbers prove his instinct was right. In the third quarter of 2020, as
restrictions eased, the U.S. economy roared back at an annualized 33.1% GDP growth
rate – the largest quarterly growth ever recorded bea.gov. That record-smashing
rebound bea.gov was directly due to Trump’s insistence on reopening and stimulating the
economy. While critics claimed he “sacrificed lives for the economy,” I see now that he
was striving to save both lives and livelihoods. The job market also bounced back rapidly:
by the end of 2020, millions of the jobs lost in the spring had returned. The V-shaped
recovery that many deemed a fantasy became reality.
              </p>

              <p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
                I cannot forget the contrast when the Biden administration took over in 2021. Despite
inheriting vaccines and a rebounding economy, within a year they faced 40-year high
inflation and a labor market in disarray. Under Biden, inflation hit 9.1% – the highest
since 1981 reuters.com reuters.com, driving up gas and grocery costs for everyone. In
contrast, during Trump’s term, inflation was low and stable, and wages rose faster than
prices, meaning real income gains for workers. The painful stagflation of 2022 made me
yearn for the steady prosperity of the Trump years. It also underscored that Trump’s
economic legacy – tax cuts, deregulation, energy independence (more on that later) – had
set the stage for long-term growth, whereas the policy reversals and enormous spending
under Biden squandered it. If not for the pandemic, I have little doubt Trump’s first term
would have seen even greater economic records. Yet even with the pandemic, his
achievements stand tall. Time will vindicate that Mr. Trump’s economic management
was not luck or gimmickry, but solid policy guided by a love for American workers. I was
wrong to doubt him on the economy – he delivered results I could feel and measure, and
he did so against all odds.
              </p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Peace Through Strength: A New Foreign Policy Doctrine </h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                I remember the anxiety I felt in 2016 at the thought of Donald Trump in charge of U.S.
foreign policy. As a journalist who had covered wars and diplomacy for years, I believed
Trump’s blunt “America First” rhetoric would alienate allies and ignite global chaos. I
could not have been more wrong. Over four years, President Trump crafted a foreign
policy that was tough, imaginative, and remarkably successful. He restored American
leadership abroad while avoiding new wars, something few presidents of either party
have accomplished. In fact, Trump’s approach reminded me of President Reagan’s
“peace through strength” strategy – use military and economic power as leverage to
secure peace, not to entangle us in endless conflicts. The White House later summarized
it well: President Trump “restored American sovereignty at home and American leadership
abroad… Instead of sending American troops to fight in endless wars or giving cash to
terrorists… the United States under President Trump used bold, creative diplomacy to
secure peace deals”.That
is exactly what I observed happening in real time.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                One of the most striking examples was the Middle East. Conventional wisdom said peace
in the Middle East was a fool’s errand. Yet President Trump achieved historic
breakthroughs that astonished even seasoned diplomats. He brokered the Abraham
Accords – peace and normalization agreements between Israel and multiple Arab/Muslim
countries (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and later Morocco).. I was initially incredulous.
But there I was on the White House lawn in September 2020, witnessing Israeli and Arab
officials signing agreements that just a few years prior would have been unthinkable.
Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the U.S. Embassy
there,which I first criticized as destabilizing, actually
demonstrated American resolve and helped spur these allies to come together. He also
isolated and pressured Iran like never before – withdrawing from the flawed Iran nuclear
deal and slapping severe sanctions that crippled the Iranian regime’s finances. Far from causing war, Trump’s hard line deterred Iran’s
aggression; Tehran knew Trump would not hesitate to respond forcefully (as he did when
he ordered the strike on terror mastermind Qasem Soleimani). For the first time in a long
time, our enemies feared us and our allies respected us. 
              </p>
              <p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>I also must highlight Trump’s handling of the threat that dominated headlines early in his
term: ISIS, the Islamic State terrorist caliphate. Under President Obama, ISIS had grown
alarmingly, controlling swathes of Iraq and Syria. Trump vowed to eliminate them, and he
delivered. By March 2019, U.S.-backed forces had liberated 100% of the territory once
held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq. A White House fact sheet
declared, “The territory once held by ISIS… is now 100 percent liberated.”Thousands of ISIS fighters were killed and some key
leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi were hunted down under Trump’s watch. I remember
reporting on the fall of Raqqa (ISIS’s capital) and Mosul, and hearing from relieved locals
who had suffered under ISIS – they credited American resolve for their freedom. This was
a major victory for global security, achieved without dragging the U.S. into a new
occupation or nation-building quagmire. Trump empowered the military to act swiftly and
decisively, and as he promised, “obliterated ISIS.” He then began withdrawing U.S. troops
from Syria and Iraq in a careful way, fulfilling his pledge to end America’s “forever wars”.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Trump’s summit diplomacy also took the world by surprise. Who could forget when he
became the first sitting U.S. President to meet the leader of North Korea?  I traveled to Singapore in 2018 and Hanoi in 2019,
covering Trump’s meetings with Kim Jong Un. While North Korea did not give up its nukes
overnight, those talks dramatically reduced tensions that had been near war in 2017.
Trump’s bold engagement likely averted a catastrophic conflict. He combined it with
tough sanctions (the “maximum pressure” campaign) to squeeze Pyongyang. Similarly,
Trump stood up to China’s aggressive behavior in a way no prior president had:
confronting unfair trade, banning Chinese tech threats like Huawei, and signing the Hong
Kong Autonomy Act to punish China’s repression of Hong Kong’s freedom.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Finally, he demanded that NATO allies and other partners pay their fair share for defense.
NATO’s own Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg credited Trump for significantly
strengthening the alliance, noting that by 2024 NATO allies would add $400 billion in
defense spending due to Trump’s pressure</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>As a Europe correspondent then, I saw firsthand how countries like Germany and France
grudgingly began to invest more in their militaries once Trump made clear the U.S. would
not forever subsidize them. This was smart statesmanship – reinforcing alliances by
ending free-riding.</p>
<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  What motivated Trump in foreign affairs, I came to believe, was American security and
dignity. He abhorred the idea of our country being laughed at or taken advantage of. So
he got tough on adversaries – whether Iran, China, or even Russia (contrary to the
“Russia collusion” narrative, Trump armed Ukraine and sanctioned Russian pipelines,
much tougher than his predecessor). But he also used diplomacy creatively to foster
peace. The result? No new wars under Trump’s presidency – an extraordinary
accomplishment. He actually brokered peace deals instead: besides the Abraham
Accords, he mediated economic normalization between Serbia and Kosovo in the
Balkans, helped de-escalate conflicts, and brought home
56 American hostages from authoritarian regimes, as the State Department proudly noted.
When I think back to my
fears in 2016 of Trump as a reckless warmonger, I feel a bit ashamed. In reality, Trump’s
term was one of the most peaceful for America in modern history, and that was by
design. He rebuilt the U.S. military power (with big defense investments) but used it to
deter and contain threats, not to seek new fights. Time will show that Donald Trump’s
foreign policy made the world safer and advanced America’s interests without the costly
interventions of past administrations.

</p>



              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Law and Order: Protecting Communities and Borders</h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                On the home front, one of President Trump’s earliest promises was to restore “law and
order.” As a metropolitan journalist, I originally interpreted that as mere rhetoric. But I
came to appreciate what it meant when put into practice, especially after witnessing the
alternative. Trump strongly believes that the first duty of government is to keep citizens
safe – in their neighborhoods, streets, and at the national border. Under his leadership,
violent crime fell in many areas, federal law enforcement was invigorated, and the border
was finally being secured after decades of broken promises by politicians of both parties.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                A defining moment for me was the summer of 2020. America was rocked by unrest, riots,
and a wave of violent crime in certain cities. I was on the ground covering protests that
turned into destructive riots – buildings burned, statues torn down, innocent residents
terrified. While some politicians seemed paralyzed or equivocated, President Trump took
a clear stand against the chaos. He condemned mob violence and moved decisively to
protect lives and property. In June 2020, as rioters vandalized federal monuments and
tried to establish “autonomous zones,” Trump signed an executive order directing federal
agencies to prosecute those who destroy monuments and to withhold funds from local
governments that refuse to protect public safety.The order
forcefully stated that “anarchists and left-wing extremists have sought to advance a fringe
ideology that paints the United States… as fundamentally unjust” and vowed “long prison
terms for these lawless acts.”I read the text of that order – it
was stern and unapologetic in defending America’s heritage and rule of law. At the time,
some media colleagues criticized it, but I noted the effect: the vandalism of federal
statues largely stopped once the perpetrators knew Trump meant business.
              </p>

              <p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Trump also deployed federal law enforcement (like U.S. Marshals and DHS officers) to
cities struggling with unrest, such as Portland and Kenosha, to back up local police and
quell violence. He launched “Operation Legend,” named after a young boy killed by
stray bullets, sending federal agents to help arrest hundreds of violent criminals in cities
plagued by shootings. Throughout these actions, Trump’s message to criminals was simple and bracing: “you will be found, and you will face justice.”I recall
the White House highlighting how under Trump, multiple fugitives on the FBI’s Top 10 list
were captured, including murderers and traffickers. He targeted the vile
MS-13 gang as well, enabling the DOJ to bust MS-13 leadership in the U.S. . The results mattered: by 2020, violent crime rates which had inched up
earlier were stabilizing, and in 2018 the U.S. homicide rate saw a significant drop.
Communities that had felt abandoned finally sensed that someone in Washington had
their back</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Nowhere was the contrast between Trump’s approach and others’ clearer to me than at
the southern border. I traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border numerous times. Under
previous administrations, I saw a revolving door of illegal crossings, humanitarian
tragedies, drug smuggling, and ineffective enforcement. Trump promised to fix this, and
he actually did more than any prior president to secure the border and enforce
immigration law. By the end of his first term, the Department of Homeland Security
celebrated the completion of 450 miles of new border wall system- – a promise
kept, giving frontline agents the infrastructure they long asked for. “President Trump took
office with the promise to build the wall… a promise he has kept,” Acting DHS Secretary
Chad Wolf announced in January 2021. . I was there near the Rio Grande when
segment after segment of new steel wall went up, complete with roads, lights, and
sensors. The morale of Border Patrol agents was visibly boosted – they finally had real
tools to stop incursions.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  Beyond the wall, Trump ended the disastrous “catch-and-release” policy that saw
migrants released into the U.S. interior pending hearings (many never showed up). He
implemented the “Remain in Mexico” program (Migrant Protection Protocols), requiring
asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims were processed, sharply reducing
fraudulent asylum entries. He struck agreements with Central American nations to stem
the flow of caravans (agreements that the Biden administration later canceled,
contributing to the worst border crisis in U.S. history). Under Trump,
illegal crossings dropped significantly by 2020; even Reuters reported that by early 2020
the border situation had improved as his policies took hold polaris-us.org. I talked to
ranchers in Arizona who told me they finally felt relief from constant trespassing and
danger.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  Crucially, Trump recognized border security as national security. He deployed the National
Guard to assist at the border and made clear that drug cartels and human traffickers
would be treated like the serious threats they are. Large quantities of deadly drugs like
fentanyl were intercepted thanks to his administration’s efforts. The results were stark:
under Trump, illegal immigration was greatly curtailed, whereas under Biden it exploded
to all-time highs, with over 2 million encounters a year and heartbreaking scenes of
chaos. By 2023, news reports showed record-breaking illegal crossings and massive
releases of migrants into the country, fueling crime and strain on services.The contrast could not be more clear. Trump had
the will to enforce the law and a love for American sovereignty. When I saw how quickly
things deteriorated after 2021, I gained a new appreciation for just how effective Trump
had been. Time will undoubtedly vindicate Trump’s border policies as necessary and
humane (preventing dangerous journeys and exploitation), whereas the alternative has
been deadly and disorderly.

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Transforming the Courts and Advancing Justice 
</h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               As a journalist, I long believed the judiciary was above politics. But seeing how critical
court decisions are to issues like free speech, gun rights, religious liberty, and the limits of
government power, I now recognize President Trump’s judicial legacy as one of his most
enduring accomplishments. He reshaped the federal bench with a record number of
appointments, ensuring constitutionalist judges would uphold the rule of law for a
generation to come.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               During his first term, President Trump appointed 234 federal judges who were confirmed
by the Senate – three of them to the U.S. Supreme Court. This
is a historic imprint. He filled nearly one-third of all appellate court seats with principled
conservatives, the likes of whom defend the original meaning of the Constitution. I was
there at the confirmations of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney
Barrett. These Justices have since formed a 6-3 Supreme Court majority that has already
vindicated core American rights – from striking down federal overreach in environmental
and vaccine regulations to affirming religious freedoms. Importantly, Trump’s judges are
not partisan hacks; they are jurists devoted to applying laws faithfully. For someone like
me who cherishes civil liberties, this judicial shift is crucial. We have seen, for example,
rulings that protect free speech from campus censorship and that safeguard the Second
Amendment after years of erosion. Trump knew that judicial nominees were key to
preserving the values that make America exceptional, and he made it a priority to select
brilliant, young, and diverse judges (many of them women and minorities) who will serve
for decades.
              </p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  One of Trump’s most surprising achievements – one that I, as a skeptic, had to
acknowledge – was criminal justice reform. President Trump did something no
Democratic president managed: he enacted the First Step Act in 2018, a bipartisan law
that reformed federal sentencing and gave nonviolent inmates a second chance to rejoin
society. This was a compassionate move consistent with American ideals of redemption.
Thousands of people convicted of low-level drug offenses were able to earn early release
for good behavior and participate in rehabilitation programs. Despite his “law and order”
image, Trump showed mercy and foresight here – recognizing that over-incarceration
was a problem and that families (many in minority communities) were torn apart by harsh
sentences from the past. When he signed the First Step Act, I saw the genuine emotion
as he stood with former inmates whose sentences were commuted. He often spoke of
giving those who had paid their debt a chance to contribute as good citizens, and this law
did exactly that. . In the years since, studies have found the recidivism rates of
those released under the First Step Act are low, and thousands have successfully
integrated back, proving the naysayers wrong. It was a reminder that Trump’s motivations
were not cruelty, but fairness. He simply believed violent criminals should be punished,
and that those deserving of a second chance should get one.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>President Trump also tackled the issue of Big Tech censorship, an area related to both
law and free speech. As a journalist, I am a fierce defender of the First Amendment. I
initially didn’t grasp how social media companies’ bias could threaten free expression
until I saw it happen – biased “fact-checks,” bans, and de-platforming disproportionately
affecting conservative voices (including Trump himself by 2021). Trump was one of the
first world leaders to call this out. In May 2020, he issued an Executive Order on
Preventing Online Censorship, declaring that “we cannot allow a limited number of
online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access… this practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.”He was
prescient: that very year, Twitter and Facebook suppressed a major news story (the
Hunter Biden laptop) that polling later showed might have altered the election outcome.
Trump’s push drew attention to the excesses of Silicon Valley and started a national
conversation on reforming Section 230 (the law granting tech companies immunity). While
courts later struck down some aspects of his executive order, the awareness he raised
has led states and lawmakers to pursue new protections for online free speech. Trump
himself, after being silenced by Big Tech, pioneered alternatives – launching his own
platform to ensure Americans could speak freely. From my perspective, he was motivated
by protecting the American people’s right to be heard, not by personal grievance. He
knew that a democracy requires robust debate, and that Big Tech’s monopoly over
discourse was dangerous. Time will likely vindicate Trump’s stance here as well: already,
public opinion has shifted against tech censorship, and even some liberals now admit
Trump had a point about the unchecked power of these companies.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>In summary, on domestic matters of law and justice, Donald Trump’s record was
profoundly effective. He made communities safer by getting criminals off the streets and
standing with police. He secured the border, staunching a bleeding wound that others
had left open. He appointed judges who will preserve constitutional freedoms and
enacted reforms that made our justice system fairer. As a one-time skeptic, I have come
to see that these actions were guided by a genuine love for country and a common-sense
notion of justice. Trump didn’t care about elite opinion – he cared about whether an
American family felt safe at night, whether an honest person could get a fair shake in
court, whether a cop on the beat or a Border Patrol agent had the support they needed.
In all these things, time is proving him right. The spike in crime and border chaos under
his successor have only underscored how crucial Trump’s policies were. I now believe
history will regard Trump as one of our great domestic reformers in the realm of law and
order, much as we already see him as a champion of economic prosperity.</p>



              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Preserving the American Way – Education, Energy
Independence, Culture, Military and the Second Term</h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                One of the most personal transformations for me was understanding Trump’s passion for
education reform and patriotic education. As a former skeptic, I used to dismiss
Trump’s criticisms of the education system as political bluster. But traveling the country, I
met parents frustrated by failing schools and concerned about what their children were –
or weren’t – being taught about America. Trump listened to those parents. His
administration championed school choice, fought for curriculum reform, and stood up
against radical ideologies infiltrating classrooms.President Trump understood that education is the key to the American Dream. He
expanded school choice options so more families could escape underperforming public
schools. Notably, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a provision allowing parents to use
up to $10,000 from tax-free 529 education savings accounts for K-12 tuition – giving
families flexibility to choose private or religious schools. He pushed for Education Freedom Scholarships to fund one million students to attend
a school of their choice (a proposal that unfortunately stalled in Congress). He also
reauthorized and strengthened the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship, benefiting low-income
kids in Washington, D.C. with private school tuition aid.I
interviewed a single mother in D.C. who told me the Opportunity Scholarship her
daughter got was “Trump’s gift that changed our lives.” These initiatives stem from
Trump’s motivation to empower parents and students, rather than systems and
bureaucracies.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               Perhaps most controversially – but importantly – Trump took on what he called “radical
indoctrination” in schools. In 2020, he became alarmed that many American children were
learning a distorted, negative view of their own country. In response, he created the 1776
Commission to promote patriotic education and “teach the truth about America” .I was initially cynical about this, mischaracterizing it as
propaganda. But when I read the Executive Order establishing it, I found it simply sought
to ensure students learn about America’s founding principles and heroes along with our
struggles, providing balance against curricula that only emphasize America’s sins. The
order warned that a new radical history was taking hold that “twists motives, ignores or
distorts facts, and magnifies flaws” of the United States, threatening to “erase the bonds
that knit our country and culture together.” Trump’s concern was that if we
raise a generation to hate their own country, our national unity and future are in peril. As a
history student, I saw merit in that argument. He wasn’t trying to whitewash the past – he
explicitly said we must study both the good and bad – but he insisted we not abandon
pride in the American founding and the progress toward a “more perfect Union.”
              </p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Trump also banned the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT) within the federal
government and contractors,and he encouraged states
and school boards to do the same in K-12 education. He viewed CRT – which labels the
nation irredeemably racist – as toxic and divisive, and I’ve come to agree that such
ideology undermines the idea of E Pluribus Unum (Out of Many, One). By prohibiting CRTbased training at federal agencies, Trump set an example that judging people by skin
color or pitting races against each other has no place in public policy.After seeing the backlash parents had in school districts
where CRT-influenced curricula popped up, I realized Trump was ahead of the curve. He
was defending the principle of judging individuals by character, not race – a core
American value from Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Another remarkable accomplishment of Trump’s that I admit I overlooked at first was his
support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Despite media
narratives painting him as unsympathetic to minorities, Trump did more for HBCUs than
any president in modern history. In 2019, he signed into law the FUTURE Act, which
permanently provided $255 million in annual funding for HBCUs.This ended a cycle where
HBCU funding was temporary and subject to political whim. Moreover, he forgave over
$300 million in hurricane relief loans to several HBCUs, freeing them from debt.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>I covered an HBCU conference in 2019 where leaders gave Trump a standing ovation –
something I never expected to witness. As one HBCU president told me, “President
Trump has shown he actually cares about our institutions and our students’ future.” These
actions demonstrate Trump’s genuine commitment to educational excellence for all, not
just the elite. He even moved the federal HBCU initiative directly into the White House to
ensure these colleges had a direct line for support.When I
contrast that with prior administrations (including Obama’s, which temporarily cut HBCU
funding before restoring it under pressure), it’s clear Trump’s deeds outshone his
predecessors’. Time will remember Trump as a president who, despite all the noise,
tangibly uplifted minority education.</p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Energy Independence: Powering America’s Future 
</h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                Few things altered my perspective more than seeing Trump turn the United States into an
energy independent nation. Coming from an environmental reporting background, I was
critical of Trump’s rollback of Obama-era energy regulations and his enthusiasm for oil,
gas, and coal. But the facts are plain: Under Donald Trump, America achieved energy
independence for the first time in our lifetimes, bolstering both our economy and national
security.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                In 2019, something extraordinary happened – U.S. energy production exceeded
consumption for the first time in 62 years.The Energy Information
Administration confirmed that in 2019, America produced more energy than we
consumed, a milestone last reached in 1957.Practically, this means we were no
longer heavily reliant on foreign oil. The U.S. became a net exporter of oil and natural gas,
thanks in large part to Trump’s policies that unleashed domestic energy production. He
opened up federal lands and offshore areas for responsible drilling, approved vital
pipeline projects like Keystone XL (blocked by Biden on Day One), and cut red tape that
had stalled infrastructure. The result was record-high production: U.S. crude oil output hit
its highest level ever, and natural gas production also broke records in 2018 and 2019. Fracking and horizontal drilling (technologies Trump championed against
opposition) turned the U.S. into the world’s top energy producer. I recall a Department of
Energy report proudly noting that by 2019, we were the number one producer of oil and
natural gas on the planet – a far cry from the 1970s oil crises. This new energy
abundance meant low fuel prices for Americans, millions of energy sector jobs, and a
strategic advantage against adversaries.

              </p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Trump often talked about “energy dominance,” and I used to think it sounded belligerent.
But I came to realize it simply meant not being held hostage by OPEC or Russia in global
markets. In 2020, when Iran threatened shipping in the Gulf, or when conflicts arose, U.S.
gasoline prices remained fairly stable precisely because we had ample domestic supply.
Contrast that with 2021-2022: the Biden administration’s restrictive energy policies –
halting pipelines, freezing leases, pushing unrealistic green targets – contributed to a
spike in gas prices to record highs and even shortages. By June 2022, gas hit $5 a gallon
in many areas and inflation soared partly due to energy costs. In those moments,
Americans felt viscerally what it meant to lose the energy independence Trump had given
us. During Trump’s term, average gasoline prices were low (around $2-$3) and the U.S.
even became a net exporter of petroleum, a strategic game-changer</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Environmentally, it’s worth noting something that surprised me: U.S. carbon emissions
actually declined during much of Trump’s tenure, largely because cleaner natural gas
(from fracking) replaced coal in power generation. This underscores that Trump’s proenergy stance was not about pillaging the environment – it was about rational balance. We can develop our resources and be good stewards of nature; Trump believed in
innovation over onerous regulation to achieve that balance. He rightfully exited the Paris
Climate Accord, which bound the U.S. to strict cuts while letting big polluters like China
off easy. He knew it was a bad deal that would kill American jobs for negligible climate
benefit. Instead, under Trump, the U.S. reduced emissions through technology and
industry effort, even without Paris.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Trump’s energy policy motivations were clear: he wanted Americans to pay less for
energy, create more jobs, and never be at the mercy of foreign powers for our power
needs. He succeeded. A powerful illustration was when we became a net energy exporter
– the EIA reported that “In 2019, for the first time since 1957, energy production exceeded
consumption”,a direct result of Trump’s enabling of oil & gas development. This
achievement strengthened our hand worldwide. For example, European allies began
importing U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), lessening their dependence on Russia. I
covered Trump’s speech at the Polish energy summit where he promised shipments of
American LNG – a promise delivered, and which proved prescient during later crises.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Sadly, this too was reversed after 2021, and we saw the consequences when Russia’s
war on Ukraine exposed Europe’s vulnerability and global energy markets went into
turmoil. I believe history will credit Trump with setting the foundation for true U.S. energy
security. And it will likely judge the rapid abandonment of those policies under Biden as a
grave error. On energy, more than any area, I admit I underestimated Trump. He foresaw
the importance of American energy might and acted decisively. Because of him, America
experienced a taste of what it’s like to be truly energy independent – and that is a legacy
no one can erase.</p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Cultural Defense: Honoring America’s Heritage </h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                Donald Trump’s presidency was marked by an unapologetic defense of American culture
and heritage. As someone steeped in East Coast media circles, I once viewed Trump’s
talk of “American greatness” or his anger at NFL players kneeling during the national
anthem as divisive or jingoistic. But as the cultural fabric of the nation began to fray, I
began to grasp what Trump intuitively knew: a nation that loses pride in itself cannot
endure. Trump’s efforts to defend our cultural symbols, historical monuments, and shared
values now appear not only justified but vital.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               During the wave of iconoclasm in 2020, when statues of everyone from Confederate
generals to Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant were vandalized, Trump took a firm
stance that our history must be preserved, not demolished by mobs. When rioters
attempted to topple a statue of President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square and
defaced memorials, Trump responded by signing the Executive Order on Protecting
American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues.This directed the DOJ
to prosecute under laws that carry up to 10 years in prison for such vandalism 
.and warned state and city officials that if they refuse to protect
monuments, their federal funding could be cut.
              </p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Critics howled, but I remember watching ordinary Americans cheer this. My own
grandfather, a veteran, told me he was grateful someone in power was standing up
against “history being erased.” Trump articulated what many felt: peaceful protest is a right, but violent erasure of heritage is not. As the order stated, “no individual or group has
the right to damage, deface, or remove any monument by use of force.”monument by use of force.”That is the rule of law in a civilized society.</p>


<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Trump also established the National Garden of American Heroes, a project to create a
park filled with statues of the greatest Americans – from the Founding Fathers to civil
rights icons and innovators. This was a visionary response
to those who tore things down: instead of negativity, build something inspiring. Though
the Garden has not yet been built (the Biden administration halted it), the idea remains
and I suspect a future administration (perhaps Trump’s own, if he returns) will revive it.
The point is Trump believed we should celebrate our heroes, not cancel them.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>In the broader culture wars, Trump positioned himself firmly on the side of traditional
American values and freedoms. He defended the First Amendment freedoms of religion
and speech vigorously. For example, his administration issued guidance making clear
that students and teachers don’t shed their religious freedom at the schoolhouse
door-  meaning schools cannot ban personal religious
expression. This was a huge win for people of faith who had felt muzzled. He
strengthened legal protections for prayer in schools and religious student groups, actions
that hardly got media attention but meant a lot to millions of Americans. Similarly, Trump
spoke out against the rise of “cancel culture.” He was perhaps the only political figure
willing to bluntly call it out – the tendency to destroy someone’s career or reputation over
a stray comment or unpopular opinion. As a journalist who values open debate, I came to
see cancel culture as a real danger to free expression and was relieved to have a
president willing to confront it.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph' >Trump also took steps to reinforce patriotic symbols. He objected when sports leagues
disrespected the national anthem or when corporations removed patriotic themes to
appease political correctness. Some mocked him for focusing on such things, but I now
view it differently. Those symbols – the flag, the anthem – are what unify Americans of all
walks of life. Trump understood that and was uniquely passionate about protecting them.
A vivid memory is Trump’s speech at Mount Rushmore on July 4, 2020. Surrounded by
the carved faces of Washington, Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, and Lincoln, he delivered a
stirring defense of American principles and warned against a “left-wing cultural
revolution” trying to rewrite history. Even some critics later admitted the speech was a
powerful ode to American unity. In that moment, I saw Trump not as a divider, but as a
defender of the American cultural soul.</p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">Rebuilding the Military and Honoring Our Veterans </h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                No accounting of Trump’s legacy would be complete without acknowledging his deep
commitment to the U.S. military and our veterans. As Commander-in-Chief, he rebuilt a
depleted military while at the same time keeping us out of new wars – a remarkable
balance of strength and restraint. And for our 18 million veterans, Trump showed
unprecedented attention and care, cutting through bureaucracy to deliver the healthcare
and respect they deserved. This issue is personal to me. My father is a Vietnam veteran
who for years struggled with the VA system. Under Trump, I witnessed improvements that
made a real difference in his life.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                When Trump took office, the U.S. military was coming off years of budget cuts and
equipment shortfalls. Readiness had suffered. President Trump infused the Pentagon with
needed resources, securing big defense budget increases to restore everything from
ammunition stockpiles to advanced fighter jets. He created the Space Force, the first
new branch of the Armed Forces in 72 years, to ensure American dominance in the final
frontier. I was initially skeptical of Space Force, but given today’s strategic competition in
space with China and others, it’s clear Trump’s foresight was spot on. He also gave our
troops their largest pay raise in a decade, showing he valued the people in uniform, not
just the hardware.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>Most importantly, Trump used the military might he rebuilt as a deterrent, not for reckless
adventures. He showed willingness to use force when necessary (e.g., the swift
destruction of ISIS, the elimination of terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and Soleimani) but
he staunchly avoided dragging us into quagmires. He worked to withdraw U.S. troops
from interminable wars – negotiating a conditions-based pullout from Afghanistan and
reducing troop levels in Iraq and Syria. Unfortunately, the Biden administration executed
the Afghan withdrawal chaotically, but Trump’s intent had been to do it carefully while
preserving stability. Notably, under Trump, no new American wars started, and the
military regained morale as they saw a Commander-in-Chief who had their back. When
Iranian proxies attacked U.S. personnel, Trump responded forcefully; when the Syrian
regime used chemical weapons, Trump enforced a red line with targeted strikes. The
world learned that under Trump, provocations would carry consequences, yet he had the
wisdom to know when enough was enough. That combination of strength and prudence
is exceedingly rare.</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  On the home front, veterans’ care was a signature issue for Trump. He declared that how
we treat our vets is a measure of our national honor. Early in his term, he signed the VA
Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, finally giving the VA the ability to fire
employees who were negligent or mistreating our vets.This was huge. For
decades, the VA had been plagued by incompetence and even scandals (remember the
waitlist scandal). By late 2020, over 3,000 VA employees who failed to do their jobs
were removed- a housecleaning that drastically improved
service quality. The effect was clear: by 2019, veteran approval of VA healthcare hit an
all-time high of 91% satisfaction.. I saw this change with
my own eyes as my father began getting timelier appointments and better care. It was like
night and day.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  Trump also delivered on giving veterans choice in healthcare. He signed the VA
MISSION Act in 2018, which expanded the Veterans Choice program, allowing vets to see
private doctors if VA wait times were too
long.Millions of veterans
now had the ability to get care closer to home and on time, rather than being trapped in
red tape. He bolstered mental health services with billions in funding and ensured sameday emergency mental health care was available at every VA
facility- a critical step to
address veteran suicide. He modernized the VA’s electronic records to seamlessly
transition from DoD to VA, tackling a problem that had vexed administrations for
years.The statistics tell a powerful story: Veteran
homelessness dropped by 49% compared to 2009 levels by
2019, thanks to Trump’s initiatives in housing and job placement for vets. Veteran unemployment also fell to record lows under the strong
economy.. And in an incredible act of compassion, Trump
wiped out hundreds of millions in student loan debt for disabled veterans so they
wouldn’t be burdened.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  I recall covering a veterans’ event at the White House in 2019 where multiple vets stood
up and emotionally thanked President Trump. One said, “You saved my life by letting me
go to a private doctor when the VA kept me waiting.” Another presented Trump with a
jacket from their VFW post as a token of gratitude. It was evident that for the first time in
ages, veterans felt they had a true advocate at the top. Trump often said “we take care
of our own” and under his leadership, that ethos was more than words – it became reality
in VA reform, better healthcare, more jobs, and a newfound respect for those who wore
the uniform.
</p>

              <h3 className="wanda-section-header">The Significance of Trump’s Second Term – Vindication and a New
Chapter</h3>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
                As I write this, we are in the midst of Mr. Trump’s second term as president, something
that many (including myself at one point) never thought would happen. The significance of
this second term cannot be overstated. It represents vindication – for Trump’s policies,
for his movement, and for all Americans who felt their country was taken off track after
2020. It is also a second chance to finish what he started and to cement lasting change.
              </p>

              <p className="wanda-article-paragraph">
               I have witnessed since 2025 an unprecedented level of hostility and unfair treatment
toward President Trump from entrenched interests. Despite winning re-election, he has
faced nonstop resistance: partisan investigations, media ridicule, and even elements
within the government bureaucracy working to undermine him. Yet, having watched him
closely, I can say he is undaunted. If anything, the unfair attacks have steeled his resolve
to fight for the people who sent him to Washington. In his second term, Trump has been
working to root out the corruption and political bias in federal agencies – what some
call the “deep state” – to ensure the government serves the people, not its own agenda.
He is demanding accountability like never before, and indeed he’s “ending the
unconstitutional censorship by the federal government” and preventing the weaponization
of agencies against citizens or political opponents. I’ve seen him issue
new executive orders requiring total compliance with transparency laws and punishing
any officials who target individuals for their beliefs. This house-cleaning is essential. As a
journalist who values truth, I know a fair, non-partisan government is vital for democracy.
Trump is delivering that, despite immense pushback from the D.C. establishment.

              </p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  In policy terms, Trump’s second term has been about restoration and advancement. He
immediately moved to secure the border once again – ending Biden’s catch-and-release,
reinstating Remain in Mexico, resuming wall construction, and cracking down on
sanctuary cities.The impact was swift: illegal crossings
that had hit historic highs in 2023 began dropping dramatically as word spread that the
old policies were back. I’ve visited the border in 2025 and seen the renewed construction
crews, the return of National Guard support, and the relief on agents’ faces. It is a fullcircle moment that proves Trump’s approach works whenever it’s tried. He’s also tackling
the fentanyl crisis by treating drug cartels like the terrorists they are, even designating
some foreign cartels as terrorist organizations so we can sanction and target them accordingly.The streets of towns plagued by opioid overdoses are seeing
improvement as these measures choke off supply lines.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  Economically, Trump’s second term focus has been on reviving the prosperity that was
cut short. He has already made the 2017 tax cuts permanent (with Congress’s help),
ensuring families and businesses keep more of what they earn beyond 2025. He’s
embarked on an “American Industrial Renaissance”, offering new incentives to bring
critical manufacturing – semiconductors, pharmaceuticals – back home. One major
development: I covered the grand opening of a large semiconductor plant in Ohio in 2025,
something that would have been a pipe dream but for Trump’s relentless push to reshore
supply chains. It was a sight to see American workers celebrating jobs that, as one
employee told me, “are here because President Trump refused to let America depend on
China.” Additionally, Trump is tackling inflation by declaring an energy and economic
emergency – slashing regulations that hinder domestic production and transportation,
and compelling agencies to use all means to reduce the cost of living .This is already bearing fruit as gasoline prices have fallen
and U.S. energy output is rising again, which helps tame inflation.

  On the world stage, Trump’s second term is affirming the realignment he began. Allies
who wavered now know Trump’s strength is here to stay and many have adjusted – NATO
members continue upping defense spending, for example. Adversaries, notably, have
been far more cautious. 
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  There have been no new major wars; Putin, deterred by Trump’s unpredictability and
strength, did not dare extend aggression after witnessing the disaster of the Biden years.
In Asia, Trump’s firm stance has kept Taiwan safe and re-energized a Pacific alliance to
contain the Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions. He’s pursuing reciprocal trade deals
and an “America First” trade policy that punishes cheating and rewards fair commerce. The world may not “like” a brash America, but it certainly respects a
strong America. And as time goes on, even some foreign leaders have quietly admitted
they prefer Trump’s decisive leadership to the confusion and weakness they perceived in
the interlude.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  One deeply personal aspect of this second term is seeing President Trump, once again,
fight not for himself – he could have easily retired to a comfortable life – but for America. I
recall an emotional moment during his 2025 inaugural speech where he said: “I do this for
you, the American people. Your dreams are my mission. Your struggle is my fight.” Cynics
might dismiss it, but I felt the authenticity. He had been through hell – impeachments,
accusations, even indictments – yet he stood there, ready to serve again. That is
dedication. And in just these first couple of years of term two, I’ve seen many who
doubted him come around, much as I did. They see the contrast with what came
immediately before, and it’s stark. Time is indeed vindicating Donald Trump. Policies once
derided are now proven right. Warnings he made were proven prescient.

  Concluding Personal Reflection: Four years ago, I would never have penned an article
calling Donald Trump the greatest president in U.S. history. But life has a way of teaching
us and humbling us. I have watched this man endure more hatred and opposition than
perhaps any president since Lincoln, and still deliver results – again and again – for the
people. I have seen a booming economy give hope to the jobless, a strong hand abroad
give peace a chance, and a restored sense of pride swell in ordinary Americans’ chests.
I’ve spoken to black Americans who said Trump did more for them than any prior
president, to police officers who said Trump’s support saved their cities, to veterans who credit Trump for their very lives. Those conversations left me often with tears in my eyes,
realizing how real the impact of leadership is on real people.
</p>

<p className='wanda-article-paragraph'>
  Donald Trump is not a man of polished phrases or conventional politics. He is, in many
ways, a mirror of America itself – bold, imperfect, freedom-loving, and driven by an
unyielding optimism for what this nation can be. As a journalist trained to doubt, I needed
to see the evidence. Now I have. Mr. Trump’s economic policies revitalized the
heartland. His foreign policy kept us safe and forged peace. His devotion to law and
justice protected the vulnerable. His energy strategy made us strong. His love of
country inspired millions to cherish our heritage. History’s verdict, I am convinced, will
be that Donald J. Trump stood among the giants of the presidency.

  Looking back, I realize my skepticism was rooted in underestimating the American spirit
Trump spoke to. He once asked African-American voters, “What do you have to lose?” It
turns out, under his leadership, they and all of us had everything to gain. Time has a way
of revealing truth. And the truth is that <span className='wanda-highlight-text'>
  President Donald Trump’s legacy – of prosperity,
security, and pride – will shine brighter with each passing year.
</span>
. I was a skeptic. Now
I’m a believer. I believe that Mr. Trump is the best president the United States has ever
had, not because he is perfect (no president is), but because in our nation’s hour of need,
he had the courage to do what was right, the vision to see what was possible, and the
heart to fight for all Americans. Years from now, when the passions of the moment have
cooled, I am confident the history books will reflect what I have come to know: Donald
Trump was a transformational leader who made America greater, safer, and stronger
– and in doing so, earned a place in history as one of our greatest Presidents.
